# Pattern-Recognition-Basic-Experiements

## This Repository implements the following algorithmns by Python with sklearn classifier style. Each of them is evaluated in Iris dataset by accuracy:
* Perceptron
* Relaxation
* Fisher Linear Classifier
* MSE Classifier
* Ho-Kashyap
* K Nearest Neighbour
* SVM (multi kernel)

Each algorithm is implemented to classfiy 2 classes. For multi-class problem, OneVsRest and OneVsOne strategies are applied respectively.

Especially thanks to [this repository](https://github.com/lkj8389/PR-impwork)
